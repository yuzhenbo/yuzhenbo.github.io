Luckily, our paper "Deep Kinematics Analysis for Monocular 3D Pose Estimation" has been accepted by CVPR 2020.

This is the better news i have heard since i have been PHD for computer science, and i will focus myself and then work hard in the future.

Later, i will try for NIPS 2020. My current work is about Action Recognition based NAS and Unsupervised Human Mesh Reconstruction.

I am interested in 3D human reconstruction, and i hope my work can be widely applied to various industry fields, expecially AR/VR/MR.

I will do some works about 3D human reconstruction and Video Pose Estimation based on NAS in the future. Hope i can be better.
